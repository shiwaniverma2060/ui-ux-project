          <p>
            For parents that grew up with dogs, there are few moments as
            emotional as introducing a new loveable canine to the family.
          </p>

          <p>
            A family dog can be a child’s best friend, teach responsibility and
            compassion, and be a warm partner on chilly evenings.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you are contemplating adding a new dog to your home, then have a
            look through our family-friendly dog breeds for more information.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Factors to Consider When Choosing a Family Dog</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Rather than sticking with the breed you know best, it is worth
            considering various other factors before pinpointing the desired
            pet.
          </p>

          <p>
            How you live, where you live, and your kids’ age can be equally as
            important as your new furry friend’s size, temperament, and energy
            level.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Age of your children</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Getting a puppy is a milestone moment for any family, but it is
            crucial to consider the age of your children for how the dynamic of
            introducing a new pet into your home will work.
          </p>

          <p>
            For example, while some giant breeds are excellent with children in
            general, toddlers can be easily knocked down when they come in for a
            friendly cuddle.
          </p>

          <p>
            Conversely, some smaller breeds can be hurt if a younger child plays
            too rough.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Size</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            The size of a dog comes down to both its height and its weight. The
            dog breed size you choose is best matched with the size of your
            home, yard, and your ability to transfer your pet in your car.
          </p>

          <p>
            The dog’s sheer size also typically equates to the amount it will
            cost to feed, which an astonishing amount of people fail to realize
            until it’s too late.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Temperament</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Some dog breeds adore children, whereas others are far more skittish
            and wary of tiny humans.
          </p>

          <p>
            While you should also consider the individual animal and its unique
            personality, certain dog breeds are undoubtedly more
            family-friendly.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Energy</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            If you are an active household that loves heading to the beach at
            every opportunity or going for long walks in the woods, then you are
            best to look for a dog with an equally high energy level.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you feel your family will be more likely to spend time cuddling
            with your furry friend on the couch binging on Netflix, then it is
            best to be on the lookout for an equally easygoing dog.
          </p>

          <p>
            Breeds that need a lot of energy or companionship will become
            destructive and bored if not stimulated sufficiently.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Care and Grooming</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Certain dog breeds shed significantly less than others, while some
            require daily grooming. Some of the cutest, fluffiest dog breeds
            require regular trips to professional groomers every six to eight
            weeks to maintain their distinctive look.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Weather</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            It is likely common knowledge that Malamutes and Huskies prefer cold
            weather. However, many other breeds shy away from sweltering weather
            as well. For example, short-snouted dog breeds or brachycephalic
            breeds struggle to cool off when temperatures rise, quickly becoming
            dangerous if not sufficiently monitored.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Cost</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Many pet owners vastly underestimate the cost of owning a dog
            throughout its lifetime. Indeed, there is the initial purchasing or
            adoption fee; however, many people fail to consider all other
            expenses involved in being a responsible dog owner. Pet insurance,
            food, toys, and vet checkups can add up. In addition, you may need a
            boarding kennel if going away on holiday or a dog daycare service if
            working full time or out for the day. Take all of these various
            expenses into consideration when isolating your preferred breed.

            <strong>
              Top 10 Favorite Family-Friendly Dog Breeds to Consider
            </strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            We have discussed some of the best factors to contemplate when on
            the lookout for a new addition to your family. From massive,
            slobbery beasts to fluffy little canines, there are a myriad of
            different options. We have compiled a list of our top 10 favorite
            family-friendly dog breeds to consider, so have a look below and see
            which would fit in best with your family.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Cavalier King Charles Spaniel</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            It’s hard to get any more darling than a Cavalier King Charles
            Spaniel. Their loveable eyes could make anyone’s heart melt. This
            breed is lively when needed but also makes a fantastic lap dog or
            foot warmer.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Beagle</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Cute, loveable, a best friend for life, a beagle can make an ideal
            pet for families willing and able to offer round-the-clock
            attention. They will happily sleep curled up on your child’s bed,
            but are also cunning escape artists, so ensure your yard is
            adequately fenced.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Dachshund</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Weiner dogs, sausage dogs, doxies, whatever you want to call them,
            dachshunds are brilliant family dogs. The standard size is more
            robust for playing with children, and the wire-haired variety has a
            loveable, clownlike character and needs minimal grooming.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Schnauzer</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Coming in giant, standard and miniature sizes, schnauzers are
            excellent for children. They are equally happy to run around the
            garden as they are to snuggle up and watch a television show. A trip
            to the groomers will be needed every few months to keep the typical
            schnauzer appearance.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Labrador Retriever</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Labs have remained a top choice for families for decades due to
            their excellent nature with kids and friendly demeanor towards other
            pets. However, Labrador Retrievers are best for active families that
            intend never to miss a chance to exercise since bored puppies will
            indeed become destructive.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Newfoundland</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Like the Lab, Newfoundland is another breed initially from Canada.
            If you are on a search for a giant dog, then the 150 or so pounds of
            a Newfoundland might just fit the bill. Add a lot of fluffy fur and
            this dog looks quite imposing; however, they are very docile and
            patient and love nothing more than nannying their children.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Poodle</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Those that discount a poodle oftentimes have never spent much time
            with them. Without the distinctive poodle trim, they look like
            entirely different dogs. The standard variety is fantastic family
            dogs if you are interested in a larger breed. While you will be
            happy poodles don’t shed, they will need a trip to the groomer every
            other month.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Golden Retriever</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            When anyone thinks of the classic Hollywood pup, we are confident
            that the Golden Retriever is often imagined. They are intelligent,
            playful, silly, and energetic, making them fabulous for families
            with plenty of kids. However, they will require a high degree of
            physical activity and best for households with at least one
            stay-at-home parent.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Bulldog</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            A bulldog might not be cuddly, and they may have a face only a
            mother could love, but they are loyal through and through.
          </p>

          <p>
            They require minimal exercise and are happy to laze in the sun but
            are best in mild climates due to their short snout.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Boerboel</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            The Boerboel is a mastiff-type breed originally from South Africa
            that was bred to defend large plantations and their families from
            lions and other beasts.
          </p>

          <p>
            Combined with their prominent appearance, they might seem like a
            typical family-friendly pet; however, Boerboels make excellent
            family dogs.
          </p>

          <p>
            They are loyal, lovable, and wonderful with children, though they
            are best for an experienced dog owner that can cope with their
            guarding tendencies.
          </p>

          <p>
            Never underestimate how quickly your puppy and your children will
            grow. Be sure to set a reminder on your calendar and take a happy
            snap of them maturing into lifelong friends. It will be a timeless
            treasure that you’ll always hold dear.
