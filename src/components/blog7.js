            its ears, and maintaining its hygiene. Dog grooming can be performed
            at a pet salon or in-home grooming business. Some dog groomers also
            offer mobile grooming services where they visit the client’s home to
            groom their dog. Dog grooming is a profession that requires a lot of
            patience, attention to detail, and a love for dogs.
